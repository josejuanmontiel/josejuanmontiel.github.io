          <h2>...my way?</h2>

          <p>If you have arrived here, you have traveled part of the road, because does it end here?</p>
          
          <p> You found (or made you) the blog posts, where I count in 4 steps, a personal reflection process ...
          that is evolving over time.
          <ul>
            <li> Reflection on the professional (and personal) path traveled these 20 years of profession. </li>
            <li> Reflection on what now (last years included) I have been. </li>
            <li> Reflection on what I want to be, that I can contribute, as I see the industry ... </li>
          </ul>
          But, I ask you again, did you walk all the way?Sometimes a step back, makes us see the forest, without them
          Trees tape, sometimes, one step back allows us to look for the hidden path, finding the key we did not expect. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="main-hidden" id="bien">
          <h2>...It is that you gave with my way.</h2>

          <p> and you gave the way, and well, now and always, there is not only one way to get there.You have been able to get it in several ways,
          Because nothing that I tell here is hidden, only begins, for those who take the trouble to investigate. </p>

          <p> because deep down, this goes for effort, commitment, perseverance ... to let yourself be loved by whoever values ​​you.

          <p> I remember that a long time ago I can't find the reference) I saw that Google was looking for workers,
          through an advertising "cryptic" that whoever was able to decipher it could start the process ... a way of
          find only the best (deciphering you advertisements) ... well this is something similar, but from another point of view. </p>
          
          <p>In the background, it is not that it is nothing new, but while towards the reflection, and I left it written, I have fun experiencing,
          And hiding part of the road, which you have discovered, you have taken the time to discover what I think.I don't have a hand
          None of <a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/business-card/">is</a> But this digital exercise is the closest thing I know
          It happened, with several goals in mind ... those that I described in the first post.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="main-hidden" id="situaciones">
          <h2>...that occurred in my jobs.</h2>

          <p>When I talk about situations, I have been thinking about people, and how people influence situations.</p>

          <p> I begin with the most problematic types of people, those that I consider toxic, which twist the situations to get to
          Where they want, which is not the success of the project, but to fail, with what objective?For pleasure, for the "I told you" ... the reasons
          They can be several, but the fact is that either you are careful or the ship wrecks.These people work at a lower performance than
          They could, only with the aim of sinking the project.Be prepared forever you can find them, therefore the best you can do
          is to develop the skill necessary to be able to deal with them, and after reflecting a lot, one could be
          Give them free, make them commit and neglect the excuses.Possibly oppose the order they have established, because
          Think otherwise (they are normally stored for them) so, once identified, they must be unmasked with education,
          be able to counteract their excuses, and give them court, so surely they would change from airs and the thing rolled, unless their level
          Professional not of the size of the problem, or they come across customers (or higher level managers) who see in them a hindrance.
          In any case, it is something that is not easy to manage, and be more than 6 months in its radius of action, it may burn the calmer. </p>
          
          <p> The next type of people, are those who try, in good faith, but their level is what it is, and when the problem surpasses you, or you put yourself
          The batteries, or put you with legs in the street.It is very difficult to know if someone has a level, and they cannot go from him (I am of the opinion that
          With effort it can always be improved, and not only in "your free time").And like the previous ones, these people exist and will always exist,
          And if you cross them with them, they should try to help them form, give them the tasks at their level, try to give you, and because
          No, try to contribute you.Depending on the demands of the project, some things or others can be done, but well, I suppose it is
          They can tolerate a couple of years, from there, there is to give them a notice, because unfortunately, in this world of computer science, one does not
          You can stagnate, and not be able to evolve, it can be a symptom.

          <p> Another type of people, always from respect, and without presupposing evil, are those who think that they know more than they know,
          With these, in principle there is no greater inconvenience, they end up falling by their own weight, so just wait, and of course, no
          They fall on you, therefore like the previous ones, you have to try to share your point of view with them to see if you get
          The balance of opinions. </p>

          <p> Another guy, who comes to memory, is that superior, wanting to do a good job with the team he has,
          But that team is not adequate for work and with what you have, you have to do the best possible, and that leads you to give 200%
          On his part, because otherwise, the objective is not reached. </p>

          <p>The cracks, are those who know, and know a lot ... the good thing about this world of computer science, is that it is very, very broad, and like
          In almost all jobs... <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4103.My_Job_Went_to_India">You have to be an expert in something, and know
          a bit of everything</a> And if you are a veteran, then you can be an expert in several things ... no problem.
          Well, there are times that you cross cracks, people with incredible knowledge and usually are pleasant.A good place,
          To know (at least sight) to these people, they were the conferences, and then the local groups.If you are lucky
          Have by your side at work, one of these crack, take advantage of it and learn from everything you can.I know as one of the guys, which we have
          commented before, and if your level does not give more, it evolves with the example of those who know more than you.Because we don't have to stop evolving,
          Our world does not stop moving and we must do it with him.</p>
          
          <p>And finally, young people wanting to learn and eat the world.If you also give, with those who are respectful, and do not believe
          More than others, it is tremendously comforting to see how they grow over time, and after a few years they can be left alone.
          And that more reward, than to train those who can help and provide value, and in turn train others with less experience than them.
          I guess the most important thing is to grow to others, to grow up, I can't find another way that this flows.If you like
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOG04Ot75jQ">Forget that he is a drummer</a> And think he is a programmer.</p>
          
          <p>And which is me?Well, I hope you tell me, but doing a little criticism: I guess I don't give my arm to twist, let's not
          I let myself be easily convinced by a solution ... and at least, I hope to share everything I learn, so that others also know it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="main-hidden" id="tipos">
          <h2>...of jobs I know.</h2>

          <p> The factory ... It is the first company where it works, the work is more or less organized, and there is little to think, little margin of
          error and maneuver, but hey, now with perspective not everything has to be architecture and use milling things, it can simply be
          Do good, fast and without mistakes, at first and with quality ... and not only I mean the tests.In my case, here I gave my first steps. </p>

          <p> The consultant ... with modern airs ... They are another type of companies, which like all, offer to solve the needs of customers,
          But providing a customization plus, with teams of people with a certain level, and that in general they are capable, both to implement the
          solution as an architecture, and not only technically but also to other levels.For this guy also pass, they cover the whole
          Rank of customer needs, and you are supposed to be a mere resource ... but well, as there are always nuances. </p>

          <p> The consultant ... small ... acquisition of talent ... it would be a case, in which by volume cannot access the necessary infrastructure,
          To be able to capture customer service, and are dedicated to acquiring talent that subtracts large consultants that have access
          to customers.Sometimes, these consultants are accessing smaller projects directly. </p>

          <p> The product company ... small ... with large, or small customers.It can be a variety of the consultant, where instead of trying
          monopolize talent that can sub-contract, try to have the means to also monopolize customers/projects, and thus have more control
          complete result. </p> 

          <p> The product company, with consulting airs ... with large customers ... a variation of the previous one, it can be that, where
          In addition the infrastructure to capture customers, you have part of that infrastructure to evolve an own product to which to get
          Benefit, you become your own client.A variation of these, is those where your only customer is you, and your product ... and the
          customers of that product. </p>

          <p> The company bought, for a large one ... "It was said to buy companies and sell them in parts", a phrase of a famous movie.Well in the end,
          In this world, when it stands out (for something good or bad) the big fish that eats the child can appear, in a friendly way or not, of
          Everything will be, and the inevitable result is that the synergies that are generated in the purchase ... sooner or later, out of necessity or for honor,
          They end up making part of the people disappear, and with less the same is done or more. </p>

          <p> The multinational ... with sub-companies ... well, here I think it ends up mixing a bit of everything seen before.That a company has
          500 thousand employees does not mean, obviously, that everyone dedicates themselves to the same, that everyone knows each other, in the end the structures have to be
          manageable, and especially with a common objective, client or group of ... the sale, theoretical, which allows the employee to change work, inside
          of the same company, with the good and bad, that that entails: "trust gives disgust" but well, it is always good to know this too. </p>

          <p> and those that I do not know ... the start-up, those of products used by hundreds of thousands of people, which are dedicated to support
          (Product, people ...) those who are dedicated to this computer science, but also to other businesses. </p>
          
          <p> What would I like to find? ... Well, at this point in my life, I suppose I am looking for stability in large companies, where I can contribute
          At different levels, and where I can learn from those who know more than me, and teach those who know less.Where has option to grow, and
          where can contribute value. </p>            
        </div>

        <div class="main-hidden" id="aporto">
          <h2>...contribute.</h2>
          
          <p> empathize with the client's needs ... In the end, you have to be clear that you work to achieve a goal that benefits
          To the client who pays the invoices, and after all the years I have been working on, I think I am able to understand the needs
          of each client and contribute in the appropriate address in each case.It is not the same a project where 100 people participate, than another
          Where with a single Squad of 4 people, it is enough to achieve the goal.A project to achieve a temporary solution is not the same
          of commitment, to another where the solution is expected to last several years (although in this world you never know).Besides, but there is another role
          That you take care of it, I can directly discuss the client to track. </p>

          <p> technically motivate ... On the other hand, motivation will be found, even in Legacy projects, as in the most innovative.Yeah
          We work to achieve a client's goal, we do it in exchange for a salary, and beyond the respectable need
          of money, I am able to motivate people to grow (and to determine those who do not want to grow, to look for the best
          Possible accommodation, although this is not good for anyone).But those who want to grow, are easily motivated when things
          They march, and it can also be done when things march worse.But as I say, you can learn from everything, good and bad. </p> 

          <p>Get the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylar#Habilidades">Intuitive aptitude</a>... I think it's the best way to act,
          In this totally technical world, where sometimes, a technological one is hidden on layers and layers of other things.But in the end, if you are
          able to see inside things and always ask how they work, then, you will be able to solve any problem.
          And that is the way of thinking that I try to teach, who wants to listen, and with it to be able to address anything that gets ahead.</p>
          
          <p> learn from good and bad ... as I have already said, it is the best way to always learn, because you will not always see that things
          They are done under your criteria, so, on those occasions it is best to learn how not to do things.

          <p> Do not think (alone) in the salary ... and because not only of money can be lived, to learn new things (not modern) or
          to see how customers solve the problems, how difficult situations are managed, and because not to laugh with
          the classmates, to understand the situation of each one ... all that affects performance. </p>

          <p> and in the end, among other things, the most important in this world of computer science, are the programming languages ​​that allow
          the resolution of the problems.And when I started Java was what was fashionable, and with that I started and I was more than 17 years, touring
          All frameworks, stacks and types of servers ... and when Java 9, began to take pace ... I went to golang, and with that language I have
          I have been 3 years old.And the truth is that I like it, and I like it a lot, and although it does not bother me to continue encoding in Java, I like them
          But do it on Go for its simplicity. </p>
          
          <p> On the other hand, if we consider other types of languages, also dominate (to another level) the: html, css, js, sql ... </p>

        <div class="main-hidden" id="formandome">
          <h2>...I have in mind now</h2>
          
          <p> Although I think I have an acceptable English level, for a technological worker in Spain, one of my goals is to validate
          that I can get further ... a minimum of B2 and one day not too far a C1.My reading level and technical listening is good,
          But my speaking, due to lack of practice, is still improvable.

          <p> On the other hand, although I have knowledge of Cloud, and a normal user level, if I have time I would like to be able
          Certify, starting with GCP. </p>

        <div class="main-hidden" id="ideal">
          <h2>...Where everything joins.</h2>
          
          <p> As a final reflection, I suppose people always will be there, the good, the bad and the worst.Touch to deal with each one,
          And the most difficult, not take the problem out of work.On the other hand, customers who spend money, do so in exchange for
          A result, and that is the objective of your work, get the result in the most optimal way.Therefore, you can become a
          expert capable of getting the most optimal (fast, adequate, ...)
          Being x times more optimal, and that value cannot be very high, and also varies according to other external conditions.And during the time that
          It lasts the development of the objective, to be able to do good around you (both to the code and to people).And then, be able to expand
          That goal to the company where you work, if it is good for others, it will be for you.Conclusion, "Flow", I adapt ... but
          Consider as I am. </p>
