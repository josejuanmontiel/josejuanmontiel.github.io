                    <h2>...How a Tech tribe is hired.</h2>
                    <p> I remember the selection process, I get the attention that they did not ask for CV but had the updated LinkedIn profile.So
                    Say a review and take the opportunity to do a skill test, which seemed interesting to me.The funny thing is that I approved the first of Go, but
                    I suspended Java's, which was the language I had most used in the last 18 years.The fact is that with all that updated, they called me
                    To make a talk with the person in charge of the group, along with another partner who also dominated Go, because being an expert in GO was a requirement
                    indispensable.There were enough things, and well in the end between. </p>

                    <h2>...bazel, monorepo, stack.</h2>
                    <p> And the truth is that what they had mounted was impressive.Technologies to highlight, Bazel as a Build, Build to monorepo tool
                    Giant, well, surely Google's or goal are much larger, but for the few (none) I had seen so far, it was giant.
                    And of course, everything was mixed in that monorepo, front, back, java, go.I will not extend much, but in general everything was quite organized, in another
                    Monorepo was managed the configuration to get the CD/CI, and finally another repo for infrastructure issues.Sincerely Bazel Me
                    It seemed quite ugly at the beginning, but in the end he ends up taking his taste. </p>

                    <h2>...New tools for the usual orchestration.</h2>
                    <p>It turns out that we were going to migrate a legacy piece to the new architecture within the monorepo, and in the end it was decided to orchestrate the flow of the
                    application use <a href="cadenceworkflow.io/">Cadence</a>. The truth is that it seemed quite interesting, and soon I was already caught as I was going
                    that. We organize the application using hexagonal architecture, and well, in the end everything worked quite well.Until development stopped
                    To prioritize other things.

                    <h2>...Or how you learn from the Legacy, and even take love.</h2>
                    <p> and well, during migration I also had to do the maintenance of the legacy, and as small fixes were made, it was learned about how
                    It worked, and when I stopped the new development, I was in charge of another legacy, this was a little less old, but it was older than my little daughter.
                    In the end, it is learned that the Legacy are not so bad, and that if they are given love, they can be maintained, and even improve.

                    <p> In that last phase, I began to participate in the monitoring meetings of the functional people BPO were called here, and the truth is that I
                    They seemed quite productive workflows, because they grouped other parts of the business that were much more in contact with customers
                    Reales that we, the developers, and that they could give us a more real vision of what was needed.The paste, who had to transmit the
                    Requirement to development people, and sometimes something could be lost, so being in those meetings gave me an interesting point of view, as in
                    measured with two worlds. </p>

                    <p> The truth is that the greatest groups, the more difficult it is to get synergies, and if the starting objectives are not directly the same,
                    The thing is complicated ... prepare for what can come?Or try to solve what is already here?Or both?The balance is complicated,
                    But it is the key to getting things to work.
