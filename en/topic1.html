                    <h2>...my uncle.</h2>

                    <p>If I stop to think, my first contacts with computers were thanks to my uncle Pepe. We did not see it very often,
                    Maybe that's why we were going home every time I was surprised with those devices ... I would be about 6 years (1984) and in
                    His house was a commodore 64 (and also a lot of circuits, chips, resistances and more things that I did not know and seemed to me
                    mysterious).In fact, one of the most entrenched memories I have, is to draw a tele-directed car, with all kinds
                    From Gadget (which we finally do not build, but hey, that does not mean that) ... years later (with 12, in 1990) I welded my first circuit:
                    An amplifier, which I put in the cardboard box where they sold a toner.</p>

                    <p>But, let's put aside electronics (something I have always foolish, and I don't dominate) and return to computer science.
                    I remember that when a friend of mine began to mess with the sprites of his MSX, I had a commodore 16 (which for my misfortune
                    I had no games) so, from a magazine I took out the code of some game (which I had to type, and not typed), it was still a child ...
                    They would have to spend many years to begin to assimilate certain things.</p>

                    <p> Every time I went to my uncle's house, I remember the Commodore tapes, and later the 5 1/4 albums.I remember a summer, in which I
                    dedicate to rendering some sources, for a program I was doing ... They weren't Truetype, but I drew the silhouettes (I think only in capital letters),
                    Of all the alphabet, and the numbers too.Today there are other tools for that, curiously I have thought that my daughter uses her lyrics to
                    Generate Truetype sources that I will use in a children's story, but that is another story. </p>

                    <p> Later, other adventures come to memory ... But hey, memories will always be with me, and those teachings, too.
                    And not only the teachings that only with three fields was enough to index a table in DBASEIII, but you always give it
                    Better of you, but without stepping on others. </p>

                    <p> It may still be in a bank, a conciliation process, with a different approach, whose results will turn to the mainframe from the
                    RS-232 port of an i368. </p>                  
                  </div>
                
                  <div class="main" id="la_universidad">
                    <h2>...University.</h2>

                    <p> It was the year 1996, Google had just left, at the University there was a high speed connection ... I did not go from those of those of those
                    that came from the BBS .. but I remember having a "pot" that they gave with the newspaper to connect to
                    Infovia (I think it's called), I never connect it.Everything was starting to take off ... and many others, they had been
                    Over there. </p>

                    <p> at the University of Murcia, I remember that there was an apartment (I think they are called now) that they were
                    All day around the campus with a buggy ... they said they were designing an autonomous vehicle that would make trucks
                    They will travel in convoy.I also remember that at that time, in Murcia, the bachelor's degree came out but I did the systems engineering. </p>

                    <p> Although my house was 1 hour from the university, which now living in Madrid, is seen in another way, I was lucky
                    To be able to stay on one of the campus inside the university, and that, I have to thank my parents.And from there, I met
                    My first -year partners, and I had a good time ... so good ... that that first course I only approved discreet mathematics, and by the hairs. </p>

                    <p> Had I told you that I am going to assimilate that I was about computer science? ... that first year, I was collected, along with the
                    80% of the class, yes ... bad of many, comfort of fools.They said that the university was hard, now I think we were
                    Too soft.But well ... </p>

                    <p> There were subjects that I now remember with love: programming methodology (programming in pseudo-code),
                    Operating Systems, Statistical Mathematics, Circuit Programming, Database Design ... in short, a lot of subjects,
                    A lot of practices: design of an elevator system, an implementation of Bash Linux ... a lot of things, than when
                    You are young it is hard for you to see and understand, but now from a distance ... you understand in another way. </p>

                    <p> Maybe teachers did not strive, or perhaps it was your thing ... thing of your circumstances.I remember a conversation
                    With an Italian friend, in which he told me: "Your grandfather can give you the best advice of your life, but, or you feel it in your meats,
                    or you will not be able to assimilate it "(or something similar) </p>

                    <p> and I suppose some of that happened, the first year was blank, in the following 4 I took out all the subjects except three ...
                    So the last year, it was a walk, it gave me time to learn to skate (blessed free configuration credits) to play
                    Hockey Line, to take a girlfriend and discover the world before me ... we had entered the new millennium. </p>
                  </div>
                
                  <div class="main-hidden" id="primer_trabajo">
                    <h2>...He was a systems fellow</h2>

                    <p> That last year (or perhaps the previous one, I don't remember) gave me time to do several things, including a friend got me
                    A systems manager position in a biochemistry department, where they were dedicated to calculations to build new macro-molecules
                    For scientific use ... (look, those things were already done 20 years ago and without ia) and there it had a good connection to use the audioGalaxy,
                    I learned to edit the department's website, via FTP connections to upload documents.There I spent three months, until the department
                    I exhaust the budget and I learned the basics. </p>

                    <p> After that phase, the next place was in Acisa, a company in my city that was engaged in RPG400 programs,
                    It was a small fellow phase, where I spent a little time ... but it gave me time to learn a bit of "assembly" for mainframes. </p>
                  </div>
                
                  <div class="main" id="formacion_empleo">
                    <h2>...For unemployed ... and Meta-10</h2>

                      <p> and another of the things that the last year gave me time, went to aim at a network course for unemployed.It was a course of
                      450 hours, and the truth is that there I learned a lot of things, they even validated me as free configuration credits
                      (like the skating course). </p>

                      <p> On the back to my city, I also gave me another course for unemployed, in this case of web design, at that time,
                      The resolution of the screen was detected and designs were made to adapt to that resolution, the images ... you had several sizes
                      to load faster without waste of KB.Anyway, we are talking about the end of 2002. </p>

                      <p>
                      I was ready to look for real work, of that which paid you 600 euros per month.And I found it in a company that was dedicated
                      to the balance in broadcaster (among other things).They were expanding a market and I was within that expansion, I even remember
                      who signed two students of practices of an FP module.But there, we disrupt reports in reports reports, we did practices with
                      IP cameras I see observer ... and on the way something else came out. </p>
                  </div>
                
                  <div class="main-hidden" id="docencia">
                    <h2>...When I start together the pieces</h2>

                  <p> I already said that, during the university, it is difficult to capture the focus of things, especially at the beginning.But once I ended up,
                  I realized that what they teach you is to learn, and that was when I understood that I undertook a path of continuous recycling,
                  Learn to learn ... And you had to do it fast. </p>

                  <p> Later I would read a book: "My Job Went to India By Chad Fowler" and had a couple of chapters that came to say: "He was expert in something"
                  And I add that better in a couple of things and also "know a bit of everything" and I think there resides part of the trick to survive
                  (not to succeed, even) we must understand the guts of things, be in a constant state of question that allows us to be
                  attentive to how they work. </p>

                  <p> So when love brought me to Madrid, the first thing I did (or the excuse to come) was to make a master in Java programming,
                  We talked about 2004, Java was already Enterprise, we had the EJB2.1 and a lot of more things.I saw how the guts of things worked,
                  for example the AWT graphic system of Java.I kept asking me how everything worked inside. </p>

                  <p> During the master I remember that some things happened, the attacks in Madrid in Atocha (11-M-2004), and also, my father came to Madrid
                  to operate a prostate cancer. </p>

                  <p> and once the master ends, and before testing everything learned, they offered me to give a 60 -hour Java introduction course.
                  And it was interesting, having to face teaching what I knew others, without the possibility of error, following a agenda, and some
                  students who did not want to be there.Teaching in its different variants is always a world full of challenges.</p>
                  </div>                
                  <div class="main" id="madrid">
                    <h2>...That the bubble is no longer what it was.</h2>

                    <p> and between some things and others we planted in April 2004, the abundance of 96-2000 ... It had already passed, but I did not know.To those
                    Ages were not as attentive to the market as you are now, and less coming from outside the capital.Everything that happened during the
                    Last years of university, I did not know, but well, there were still available jobs. </p>

                    <p> I remember that I did a few interviews, even some with exam ... and in some I arrive at a personal interview.
                    Finally ended in an 80 employee vectorsf that was at the facilities of the Alfonso X El Sabio University.
                    </p>

                    <h2>...My first job in the capital</h2>

                    <p> I still remember how to be part of a group, which was growing, that of portals, for that time with Fatwire 5.5.
                    One of the first requests that made me, was to build a bookstore of operations with chains to use in the JSP ...
                    replacement functions of chains and similar things, things that did not exist in the standard library and saved lines in the JSP. </p>

                    <p> And when the group began to be greased, we got down to work: the Banesto shareholder portal (2004 still)
                    We received some html models that we chopped and we were injecting them in the JSP where the contents were it, a Te Temlating system.
                    From there things begin to accelerate, I remember that one night tightened because we did not reach the delivery date,
                    At the exit of the University, a police control passed in a town on the way to home ... It was 3 in the morning, and the entrance control and
                    The departure of the town ... I remember as the second policeman told me: "But man, say that we have stopped you." </p>

                    <p> The group grew, life was happy, you breathe a good atmosphere, and it grew so fast that I had to move to the farm, the portal group
                    It was the last to move, we had to finish the last portal for Santander. </p>

                    <p> curious things at that time: we were at the orders of another consultant in the functional part ... I also remember how we acquired a
                    Small group of people from another company ... I remember going to help the group of consultants to get on time ... Life was entertaining.

                    <p> While all that happened, I remember that the contest won, with the best idea for a corporate Christms (experts were in charge).
                    I remember a thematic Christmas party in an Italian restaurant Mafia style.I also remember how we improve the editing tools it provided
                    Fatwire to be able to accelerate the developments ... there was a bit of everything ... and one was growing professionally in his first job, I even considered changing
                    of work, I remember how at that time it was said ... that it only earned more if you changed work, and try ... but someone convinced me that if
                    The portals were small, I could continue to grow in another new section, which was being created: Pure Java. </p>

                    <p> In Santander they had another one that was on eclipse and with which you could connect balls to perform flows without chopping a single line of code.
                    Well, one of the first things I did in that group of Javeros was to schedule one of those balls, which below a FTP connection,
                    And for this I did my first Pull Request (at that time it was not called that yet, I think it was even CSV the control of versions) to the
                    Apache Commons Project <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/changes-report.html#a2.1"> deado FTPS (TLS and SSL) IS Now SUPPORTED.
                    Thanks to Jose Juan Montiel, Paul Ferraro, and Satoshi Ishigami. </a> </p>

                    <p> Once that first challenge has been overcome ... the thing continued to encourage, the team grew and say with good teammates, with more experience, to learn.
                    And the projects were advancing, encrypting an Explorer Internet plugin that took metrics as soon as they took the pages.
                    There was a quality tool, similar to those that were then ... and there is now, and I dedicated myself to making rules, which I had to travel the syntactic tree
                    of the analyzed code (ast or whatever you want to call it).There was also an internal reporting tool that was evolving.Anyway, they were happy times. </p>

                    That I ran through my veins, I thought it was time to change to see what was moving in the world.And although I remember someone told me:
                    "What is missing to see the rest, if you know that it is worse than what you have" but as we have already said, but you suffer in your meats, it seems that you do not learn. </p>

                    Responsibilities, I was head of project, I had to decide how to do things.If I stop to think, I still remember details ...
                    They used VisualSourcecode from Microsoft, as a version control system, and as it was a move, mount a SVN in my laptop,
                    It was not yet fashionable git, but another rooster would have sung us. </p>

                    Internet Explorer 6, which already sounded old in 2007, and took too long to rendering, but hey, as the solution was with JSF+ejb,
                    In a couple of days we were referring the pagination, it was not so serious either. </p>

                    <p> The fact is that I remember that the matter already twisted from the beginning when we were going to work in the client offices, which caught me
                    better than where they sent me at the end, the space was pasta ... and the pasta never left over. </p>

                    <p> They also put me to a couple of boys of my age (or even old).
                    Implement the project.As one of their bosses told me later, I came from having a bad time in another project and it is seen that I did not want to repeat it. </p>

                    <p> In the end the thing was twisting, but I am not sure that it was my everything, in the end, there are things that are out of your reach,
                    And more when you are a pipiolo.It would still be to learn to do my best, and I wouldn't care what others thought ... what you can't
                    Control, toxic people who touch you around you. </p>

                    <p> So, after 6 months of a roller coaster of emotions ... I made the jump again, this time through another smaller consultant, and started
                    Work on maintaining Renfe ticket sales, long distance (I think I remember). </p>

                    <p>
                    Enter to be part of a group of 3, one from Renfe, another boy and me.We had a phase of adaptation to the systems, and if I tell you the truth
                    I don't remember if we do something in "production."I remember that I apply for the existing code, of the interrelation with other equipment/bookstores,
                    even new developments for pdas for reviewers (those PDA wore an IBM J9 virtual machine ... Remember the end of 2007, from
                    Android still nothing.Anyway, only 16 years ago (at the time of writing this) but in this world ... that is an eternity.</p>

                    <p> Anyway, that an old companion gave me a touch, in case I wanted to unite his new company and not late to decide.I remember how
                    When I communicated it to the person in charge of Indra (who was the one who carried the project) they asked me if in my consultant they did not treat me well,
                    that they could hire me, I said no ... And they said: So the project does not motivate you?And I said yes ... seen now with perspective,
                    Maintenance does not have to look like something bad, it gives you time to learn (even other things) and although people say no,
                    You can always improve a legacy code with small iterations, introspection with test mechanisms can be made, in short, there are a thousand
                    Ways to put hand to the code, to improve it and not get bored, always giving your best.But if the problem is that you do not want to give
                    The best of you, then, you run the danger of being noticed. </p>

                    <p>From that time (2007/08), I remember using my Nokia N900 to read RSS, which I had previously downloaded, while I was going
                    to curre in subway.I remember listening to podcast of all kinds, including those of <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/04/17/podcast-1/">
                    The Stackoverflow Foundation</a> In fact I remember entering <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1713/accreativos">in the previous
                    Registration </a>, then do not use it so actively (just consult, of course).At that time he was quite restless (and now
                    I keep feeling it, but I only have free of time for the sofa at night, after bedtime).I also read technical books, everything that
                    It fell into my hand (and today too, only that I am much faster and optimal assimilating).</p>

                    <p> My new company was a product company, 3 products to be exact, and I finally between electronic invoice.

                    <p> and inside the electronic invoice, he gave me to learn a lot of things: I put myself up to date with maven2/3 (migrating the build from ant),
                    At Java level, advanced a lot in language architecture, I put up on digital signature (XML), I also learned about
                    HSM, on J2EE application servers (from JBOSS to Websphere), databases, on the front I also had to make my steps. </p>

                    <p> I also did things with selenium for automatic tests (in case I do not go to this day I have done things with Chromedp), work with Altova
                    Style Vision for XSLT handling, sending messages to JMS tails, migramos from Oracle to PostgreSql, we also made front with JSF.The

                    <h2>...You have to learn from everything</h2>

                    <p> The truth is that at the beginning it was conflictive with my superior (not the partner who called me) but with whom I was in charge of the product of
                    bill.In the end, I came from an environment where the tension was less, and I had always applied my ideas, and sometimes when another thought
                    Different, I lacked touch to discuss it.That has improved with age, in fact I improve soon, now dialogue until I win
                    By K.O.Technician or abandonment: D </p>

                    <p> Another thing I improve, was to bring the notes on the work of each day, we did not talk about a flagbugz (which was what was spent on this
                    company) but of something more personal.From those days, I write down in a txt or less with the hours, what I do every day, important things,
                    Problems that arise, solutions ... The technical aspects that arise and learn, then go to specific files.Come on,
                    that I use my small classification in text files to carry a historical one, which comes very well when you have to look back.

                    <p> Once the initial frictions were resolved, things began to march.They even proposed to lead the product, when
                    My superior sets out of the company.And well, things marched ... until they stopped leaving, the accounts did not go out and I had to make cuts. </p>

                    <p> At that time my personal situation was complex, my second daughter was about to be born, my father for a few months who had died
                    For a cancer, and the person who brought me, I took another place again.</p>

                    <p> I will always remember, for the meaning of the dates ... January 8, 2013, the year my second daughter was born, the day my father,
                    I would have turned years, but I would have died the previous summer. </p>

                    <p> and that it was cooked in 2013, Globalia wanted to rebuild the Halc√≥n Viajes website it had and decided to do it with technilogical, which at that time
                    It was a small company of no more than 30 employees.Apparently, authentia had mounted a proof of concept: a content manager to
                    Measure with content manager and spring (the boot had not yet come out, that if ... with few XMLS), and a front (from the back) with Ember ...
                    Ah, and to render on the front (in the back) Thymeleaf.Anyway, that's what became fashionable at the time. </p>

                    <p> It was a matter of setting up a group, which arrived until the 10 people at some point, and that the first 6 months were displaced in the
                    Globalia offices in Pozuelo (or there, I don't remember).The truth is that coming from where I came from, I don't cost me much to adapt, to the
                    technology, or people.The challenge was interesting, things to learn (more) and a good group (even, because no, the consultant of
                    Authentia I liked).And there we were giving hard to the CMS that linked with the reserve engine that they already had mounted.It was a challenge, but
                    at no time a burden. </p>
                                     
                    <p> and once we got the milestone, we returned to the offices, which were by Doctor Fourquet, and we continue to grow, and by the end of the year,
                    but I remember badly, the maintenance group of the Halc√≥n Travel portal was amounting, something else came out, which I do not remember now that it was,
                    And finally, I had to make the Aeuropa Content Portal. </p>

                    <p> I remember that they put me with two teammates, who had been partly during the previous year and now we were 3 to full,
                    But another new partner for the front.The bases were the same, but I remember that we turned around the concepts,
                    To make them more comfortable.We removed ourselves Ember and we went to Backbone, to the Core of Contents we turned around for it to be more comfortable
                    The creation of new types of content, we have made some more tunning.Anyway, with little we got to work, the thing Marcho. </p>

                    <p>At that time, I was even<a href="https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Hackathon-Lovers/photos/23128902/385556502/">meetups...</a>donde
                    I was lucky to meet a good friend who was dedicated to hardware.This opens a new extra labor via, but it gave me to program
                    an integrated micro (more powerful than the PIC and Arduino ... but less than the flourishing Raspberry (of which I have one of the first
                    Silled of 2012) in short, that at that time I gave him again to the hardware.</p>
                    
                    <p> And well, everything was happiness, growth and good vibes, and surely some bad vibes too, but I don't remember those.                    

                    <p> And the truth is that it was not a stress (beyond the normal of a large project, or at least with a big client) but health
                    I was going to take its toll, two small girls, a certain family stress, to have set aside the daily exercise, in short, that my back gave me
                    A notice (February 2015), I had a protrusion in a lumbar vertebra that left me out of play for almost 2 months, but hey, it helped me
                    To realize that you have to take care of yourself: start sitting good, moisturizing, taking a walk after eating and of course: Pilates ...
                    I started with machine classes, almost customized for 6 months until it stops being a trunk to start flexing ...
                    And so on until today, where I continue to teach soil once a week, and every morning I make a 25 -minute routine that includes
                    stretching, dorsal and keep the hamstrings very flexible, and well, eat a little healthier, no soft drinks and there will be
                    Landwearing about 12 kg since then (2014-2022) and already even run about 5km in 30 minutes ... Anyway, nothing from the other
                    world, but healthy mind in healthy body. </p>

                    <p> on my return, technological continued to grow, and well, I played Leroymerlin, which at that time did not have a responsive version,
                    And they chose not to lose traffic, mount something quickly to show the web (catalog) with responsive mode.With little: spring boot 1.3,
                    Thymeleaf, Ajax, Dozer, Resttemplate I managed to ride a lot (in the back) the front I carry another person.But in 2 or 3 months,
                    We had walking. </p>

                    <p> and well, 2016 painted well (although if I look at him with perspective now, I don't know if we mosque me: d) The next client was going to be Pullmantur,
                    They were going to change the front of the portal (for which they hired a team that made them the design and the model) and we had to
                    Integrate it into Lifey 6.3, and well, someone had to have told them that Lifey had their things with the styles, and Bootstrap, and that there were
                    ways and ways to make models from scratch for Lifey.In the end I play, "compensate" all the styles of the model about writing them.
                    But well, I learned with Liafefe, and I liked it. </p>

                    <p>And to close the Leaspango year, same scheme, design equipment and user experience, and in this case the front we did.
                    I had found Hippocms (before Bloomreach bought) and ... because it was something similar to what at the time we mounted for airuropa,
                    And cool, so we took it to manage the contents, and take advantage of its ease of integration with other frameworks, in this case Spring,
                    and thus be able to serve other data origins (not only the contents of the portal) such as the listings of products and their prices.
                    All component engineering, which had to put me on websphere, and it turned

                    I had suffered in my own flesh, that is, being the person responsible for the project, and that is what happened this time, in full start
                    of the year 2016, when he had 3 projects in flight, in one, a partner was crossed a cable (or already brought it crossed) and it is seen that no
                    I liked me (or what I thought) and began to interfere in the proper functioning of the project.

                    <p> I remember commenting with the commercial manager (I was the technical manager) and perhaps the ruling was not having delegated before,
                    So I had to eat the solution and implement it alone, while I also took the other two projects. </p>

                    <p> later speaking with other colleagues who had to suffer from this person, confirmed certain ways of acting that coincided with
                    Those who had to suffer, but hey, I was lucky to get it off "soon."</p>

                    <p>The next project that I play: the <a href="https://portalagentes.axpo.com/login?contextRoot=">Axpo agents website</a>,
                    Old and new technologies ... Spring Boot 1.5, Spring Security, Lombok, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf 2.1, Oracle ... and a group of

                    <p> and then, I can't say with whom ... but it was a development for the migration of a legacy backend with websphere commerce
                    To a new architecture, keeping the API Rest of the Front.One of those APIs, that of content, was the one that we approached my group.The global solution is
                    It was based on the use of CQRS, along with eventsourcing.The solution was deployed using Onshift.Technologies cover the use of:
                    Spring Boot 1.4, Couchbase, Activemq ... and some more little thing. </p>

                    <p> In this project, it had been easy, about 150 people ... covering many areas, and each was an almost independent mini project.
                    I started learning a few months in an already formed group, and I did not get bored, I learned many new things ... as for examples of Couchbase,
                    De Springboot was already served, so I also took the opportunity to entertain myself with Activemq ... I even made a plugin for jmeter with which I could
                    generic invoke Apis GRPC ... that now it seems that there is something, but at that time I did not find anything. </p>

                    <p> and well, as in almost any project of these dimensions, the thing began to deviate a little ... and more and more, until
                    The relationship was already irreconcilable, the groups continued at their own pace, but they were falling one after another ... we (with me whether) I think
                    that we were in production a few days, then they went after and never knew what happened. </p>
