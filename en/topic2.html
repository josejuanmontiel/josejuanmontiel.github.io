                    <h2> ... how a team is managed, with other teams and a large customer.

                    <p> The next project was a full -fledged experience.They put me in the Blockchain group, I started with Quorum, to learn about
                    Everything that was possible to do ... and learning from those who already knew how it was going ... and after three weeks, it turns out that a project comes out for
                    Telefonica with Hyperledger Fabric, and I enter to make a piece in Java, which will be in charge of reading some CSV and launching some Rest requests,
                    and for this I had to use Spring Batch. </p>

                    <p> So I started as a listener in the project, and as the weeks went by trying to absorb all the knowledge that flowed to me
                    Around, you know, although your piece is isolated, it never is to know how the other pieces are going.And so, unintentionally I found myself in
                    The end of the first sprint with the project almost to start, and with almost nothing to show the client, which was the great telephone.

                    <p> This was the typical project where the entire artillery was landed, but lacking a little organization in one of the parties,
                    And that era in which I was, remained to mount the GO pipeline, and mainly for the management of dependencies (which also did not go
                    to have internet exit).Come on, the typical thing that in my place does it work with the IDE, but in the environment I have no idea how to do it. </p>                    

                    <p>And that is along with a anger out of place ... the truth is that there are many ways to inspire others, and how they tell in
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/geo-mas-all%25C3%25A1-del-l%25C3%25ADmite-10-lecciones-de-liderazgo-y/?trackingId=maA8R%2BZJ0FtDPDEzAeuf9g%3D%3D">this</a>
                    article, the person in charge did not have any of those skills, especially that of "Lead by Example", and that anger was a clear example
                    How not to teach with the example.</p>
                    
                    <p> From that moment, things also changed, for various reasons that responsible was increasingly disappearing from the
                    Scene ... until at the couple of months it disappeared completely, and there I found me alone, of "Second on board."I have to put on the
                    batteries in golang, which turned out to give the chance of being the second language of which I wanted to become "expert (if there is that)",
                    And although today I have to stop to think if the definition of the type goes before or after the name ... I stop to think that it is
                    On the contrary of Java because the guy is not as important as in Java: D, but as Go has a very small instruction game, the truth
                    is that with little you could do a lot ... and the second thing with what I put up was with Hyperledger Fabric, starting with how they were iterated
                    the elements of the network to searches ... and to discover that then they could be launched to the couchdb, for which you would have to
                    Have indices ... and organized types ... I'll tell you later. </p>

                  <div class="main" id="vicky">
                    <h2>...Women's name</h2>

                    <p> Blockchain solutions were a bit of a fallen layer, but here all the meat was put on the grill.As they said, it could
                    having solved the problem in any other way, but with Blockchain it was better (facing the public) and so it could be "finance".
                    And in addition, a great honor was given a code, any project that boards must have it: D </p>

                    <p> I started with a piece in Java, but soon I had to take responsibility for the parts on GO and those of Fabric too.
                    I have to give a little meaning to the microservice-hell that had been mounted to the first change, unifying the log system, then
                    The traceability with Jaeger.And in between, we went from traveling the network (which the first month of development only had thousands of sku, routers
                    For example, but that when that figure would increase it would not be feasible, so we went to the queries on the smart-contract, queries against
                    Couchdb).I would have to review the notes, that I have them ... I think I already comment, but I write it every day what I do, as a way of
                    Being able to consult it later if I need it, and but I remember the next great milestone was the performance, in some initial benchmark,
                    Where the SMC only recorded 1 value (or perhaps not even that) was left with which he endured 100 tx/sec and of course, it was not the same to have to call
                    One SMC to another, to see if the TX was allowed not to do so, so we put a cache to accelerate calls between smart-contract
                    keeping decoupling.And later, we had to implement operations in Batch, because network time also counts, no
                    It is the same as (although transparently) the SDK calls 20 times with 1 element to the peer, which does so with 20 elements.And the
                    Last before that ... it was to divide the large blocks .. let's say 10,000 skus skus, into smaller blocks to parallel the processing
                    In Batch and get answered before 10 minutes, Batch operations in real time. </p> 

                    <p> and in these, all those people from the beginning were only the "technologies" of industry 4.0 that were impatient because the solution
                    that brought the money, the same was not the most optimal for a client who did not want to be drawn, and towards everything that was in his hand
                    To knock down the solution. </p>

                    <p> But finally, we end up going to production, a real production, although there were still parallel systems that support
                    The real operation, this turned out only to be a parallel system with blockchain. </p>

                    <p> and from there, because they continued to face challenges, the supply chain continued to increase, and more and more cases came in
                    and some type of material (not serialized) that had not been considered at the beginning, which forces to use the imagination in modeling
                    of the entities in the blockchain to support elements that did not have key, only an amount, and that also wanted to show the historical
                    of amounts movements.That takes us to an overflow that had to redesign on the march.Between half, remember as quickly,
                    Some memory read in some microservice, and some other things.But we also managed to get out of that. </p>

                    <p> and in the meantime, those responsible in Telef√≥nica were rotating, and taught him that this was going ... and one of the last pieces that
                    It was to be assembled was the business rules engine, which in principle was going to be with Drools, but seen that they were not going to be many,
                    And that they were not going to model them, we chose to mount a drug on Go, and the truth is that it went quite well. </p> 

                    <p> and the next, the next was the Covid, which forces us to return to our homes, but as we were already a well -greased group, that was not
                    A problem, and we continue to draw releases, which already required fewer changes in the Core, and more in the reporting part. </p>

                    <p> On the other hand, a new actor appeared, who was going to assemble the piece that was going to support a part of the flow that
                    To this day there was no technicians and the withdrawal of Hub materials and the installation at the client's house.And these too
                    I have to teach them, and when they ended, because we stayed with the maintenance and evolution of that part as well. </p>

                    <p> and the last official release was for stores, to facilitate the pre-assignment work of collection materials,
                    And although this was the one that was most balanced at all levels, even with acceptance test and everything, I end up being the
                    Less used, but hey, I face the others. </p>

                    <p> and every relay, we were improving processes, managing errors, making tools to improve the day by day, we don't
                    We bored, and although Blockchain less and less, we had to tune the postgresql to get the most out, we set up a
                    generic reporting system that has nothing to envy to a crystallreports or similar. </p>

                    <h2>...pulling prices and trying to hire</h2>

                    <p> and well, almost 3 years later, it seems that money was over and how the thing marched like silk (seen from outside)
                    The client received a maintenance offer that was very economical, and fell into the trap ... or fell into the offer, without more. </p>

                    <p> and for our part, we made the most complete information transferred, we did, we made about 60 sessions minimum,
                    that gave a total of almost 80 hours of videos counting every detail of the project, I even made a map of all the details
                    technicians of each of the pieces, and well, because time passed and had to ask for a year of one month, to continue
                    Giving support, because the 3 fellows seem to be done with reins.

                    <p> But as I said before, and I do not say it now: "You have to worry about what you can control, and that is, the best
                    of oneself at every moment, and what is not under your control, because nothing ... "</p>

                    <p> and suddenly one day, when it was already clear that another stayed with maintenance (not so clear the exact moment of the relay)
                    They tell me that by January I enter another client.Things here go like this, you have to bill, and today you are here and tomorrow there.The only
                    What happened is that I had been in the same place for 3 years, making the wheel turn, and what if I turned. </p>

                    <p> But hey, take the opportunity to take note of the new requirements of the new project, and put me up to date.</p>

<p> and I suppose that, perhaps for spending 2 years working from home (how comfortable he hears) but, that contact is missed,
And perhaps more than those 2 years, the 4 that I had outside my parent group, which although in Accenture we are Oneaccenture, but hey,
Many of the comrades of the beginnings undertook on their way to other places, and "today there is almost no one from those of before" </p>

<p> But hey, I had to make this reflection.And here I leave her written in case you get to her. </p> </p>
